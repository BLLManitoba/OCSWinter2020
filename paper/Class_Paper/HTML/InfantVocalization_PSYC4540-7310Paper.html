Authors of the present study collected data from 626 undergraduate students who listened to 100-500 ms audio clips of infant vocalization. Researchers asked participants to identify infants in the audio clips as male/female, English/non-English, and 0-7 months/8-18 months/19-36 months of age. Participants were unable to determine the sex of the infant better than chance but were able to determine the infant&rsquo;s language and age significantly better than chance, </span><span class="c0 c16">t</span><span class="c1 c16">(463)= 4.4618, </span><span class="c0 c16">p</span><span class="c1 c16">&nbsp;&lt; .001, and </span><span class="c0 c16">t</span><span class="c1 c16">(463) = 17.714, </span><span class="c0 c16">p</span><span class="c1 c16">&nbsp;&lt; .001, respectively. Exploratory follow-up analyses did not reveal an effect of caregiving experience, childcare experience, or participant gender on a participants&rsquo; ability to correctly identify the infant&rsquo;s age or language. This research has implications for determining what is and is not perceivable in infant vocalizations. This is an underrepresented topic in infant research as most work has demonstrated what infants can perceive; not what caregivers can. This is an important contribution because infant language development has been demonstrated to include a complex social dynamic between adults and infants.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c0 c16">Keywords:</span><span class="c1 c16">&nbsp;infant vocalization, </span><span class="c1 c16">babble</span><span class="c1 c16">, </span><span class="c1">BabbleCor</span><span class="c1 c16">, language acquisition, adult identification of infant vocalizations</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c5"><span class="c4 c1"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c10">What Can We Perceive In Infant Vocalization?</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c16">Most research in infant language development focuses on the infant perspective. However, infants&rsquo; communicative experiences do not happen in a vacuum but rather in interactions with adult caregivers. Examining this process from the adult perspective is underrepresented in the literature. The ability of an adult to identify infant characteristics such as age, language, and sex could be informative for our understanding of the role that caregivers play in infant language development. Variables such as the adult </span><span class="c1 c16">listener&rsquo;s gender </span><span class="c4 c1">and infant caregiving experience may also be important factors that predict their ability to communicate with infants and discriminate between infant characteristics.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c1">The interactions between caregivers and infants have shown to be integral in the development of prelinguistic vocalizations. Goldstein and Schwade (2008) conducted a study investigating the effect of social feedback on preverbal vocal development. In this experiment, mothers were instructed to either respond contingently or non-contingently to infant babble. Infant vocalizations were measured before and after caregiver responses. The researchers discovered that infants restructured their vocalizations when their mothers responded directly to their babbling. Infants would modify their babbling to fit the same phonological form as their caregivers. These results revealed that some aspects of vocal development require social feedback from the infant&rsquo;s caregiver. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c16">A study conducted by </span><span class="c1 c16">Warlaumont et al. (2014)</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;similarly tested the role of social feedback on the language development of children with and without autism. Across trials, the researchers found that adults respond more readily to speech-related infant vocalizations than non speech-related vocalizations. Additionally, in typical development, infants were more likely to produce a speech-related vocalization if an adult was sensitive to their last vocalization. Thus, increased adult responsiveness can produce more speech-related vocalizations. This increase in speech-related vocalizations will consequently increase adult responsiveness. This evidence supports the existence of a social feedback loop, further solidifying the role of infant-adult interaction in speech development.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c1">Research examining adults&rsquo; abilities to determine characteristics of infants based on their vocalizations is dated and somewhat inconsistent. One study by Olney and Scholnick (1976) found that when researchers provided infant vocalizations to adult listeners they were able to determine the relative age of an infant. Olney and Scholnick also found that adults were unable to identify the linguistic community that an infant belonged to. Furthermore, Atkinson et al. (1968) noted that adult listeners struggle to identify infants&rsquo; native languages. However, de Boysson-Bardies et al. (1984) suggested that adults may have some ability to determine the language that an infant is learning.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c1">These findings suggest that adults may use linguistic cues to identify and discriminate between types of preverbal speech and characteristics of the preverbal infants, though researchers have primarily focused on the former. Also, variables such as the listener&#39;s gender and caregiving experience are somewhat absent from the relevant analyses that examine preverbal discriminative ability. Some previous studies, however, have investigated the effects of preverbal discrimination training and child-rearing experience on infant speech indentification. Gladding (1979) found that, in comparison, trained adult listeners were significantly better at identifying infant cry signals than untrained adult listeners. Therefore, previous exposure to these signals (e.g. child-rearing) may mediate improvements in preverbal identification and discrimination. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c16">In a more recent study, Lindov&aacute; et al. (2015) found that adults with children were significantly better than adults without children at identifying positive and negative preverbal infant vocalizations. Additionally, the researchers found that younger adults were more accurate at discriminating between the six infant vocalizations when compared to the older adults. However, Lindov&aacute; et al. also found that a listeners&rsquo; gender was not a significant factor in discriminating </span><span class="c4 c1">between the infant vocalizations.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c16">A more specific line of research for studying infant language development is in the study of babbling. Babbling is the</span><span class="c1 c16">&nbsp;early stage of language development where utterances are sounds without recognizable meaning. It appears to be a universal behaviour of infants that is even present when the infants are only learning some form of sign language (Petittio, 2004). Babbling is typically categorized into canonical or non-canonical babbling. Canonical babbling can be defined as babble containing a well-formed vowel and a consonant (E.g. &ldquo;ba&rdquo; or &ldquo;da;&rdquo; Lee et al., 2017). Infant vocalizations (excluding vegetative noises, laughing and crying) that do not have this structure are called non-canonical babble. </span><span class="c1">The ratio of vowels to consonants is often used to mark the transition from non-canonical to canonical babble. This ratio has been shown to decline from birth (at the 0&ndash;2 month stage the ratio is 4.5:1) to 8 months; during the 4&ndash;8 month stage the ratio becomes 2.8:1 (Kent &amp; Murray, 1982).</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c2 c10">Characteristics of Infant Vocalization</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1">There is some research that has explored whether there are differences in infant vocalizations between males and females. Sex related biological markers have been connected with verbal development. Estrogen has been positively correlated with verbal development while testosterone has been negatively correlated (Quast et al., 2016; Adani &amp; Cepenac, 2019). As early as 4 weeks old, it becomes evident that infant girls develop ahead of boys in verbal acquisition (Adani &amp; Cepenac, 2019). Adani and Cepenac (2019) found FOXP2 proteins, that contribute to enabling verbal expression, are less present in the left hemisphere of 4-year-old boys than girls. This research supports the possibility that there are developmental differences in infant vocalizations between the sexes. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A more extensive body of research has examined the extent that babble reflects the infant&rsquo;s ambient language. According to Jakobson (</span><span class="c1">1941/1968</span><span class="c1">), it was initially proposed that infant babble reflected biologically driven patterns that were universal across language environments</span><span class="c1 c3">. Early work also supported the idea that adults could not discriminate between the babble from infants acquiring different languages (Atkinson, 1968). However, a conflicting perspective suggested that babbling increasingly mirrors verbal characteristics of the eventual mother tongue during language development</span><span class="c1 c3">: T</span><span class="c1 c3">his effect is called &ldquo;babbling drift&rdquo; (Brown, 1958). Continuing research provided considerable support for the interactional theory with vowel sounds in babbling mirroring the mother tongue across languages (Alhaidary &amp; Rvachew, 2018; de Boysson-Bardies et al., </span><span class="c1 c3">1984, 1989</span><span class="c2 c1 c3">).</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c3">Prosody, the intonational and rhythmic properties of a language, has been analyzed in infant babbling (DePaolis et al., 2008). Language groups (for example, Indo-European and Turkic) vary in prosody and this variability is reflected in infant vocalization. However, differences in prosody have not been shown to be detectable in the babble of languages within a language group (e.g., French and Italian; DePaolis et al., 2008)</span><span class="c3 c35">.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c3">Research regarding age indicators of babbling are inconclusive (Best et al., 2016; </span><span class="c2 c1">Eimas et al., 1973). There has been a longstanding debate among researchers whether biophysical events or perceptual-linguistic experiences drive the development of infant vocalic utterances (Snow, 2006). For example, Snow (2006) showed that infants follow a &ldquo;u-shape&rdquo; development in pitch and intonation. Infants of 6 to 8 months demonstrated similar intonation as those of 21 to 23 months. This supports the theory that the babble of infants at 6&ndash;8 months old has biological prelinguistic tendencies. Furthermore, Snow (2006) indicated that infants at 18&ndash;20 months could actively control pitch, whereas between these two stages researchers observed a regression in intonation and pitch control. Changes in vocal development have also been observed between 0 and 8 months, for example Kent and Murray (1982) demonstrated that structural components of infant babble change significantly during this period. The researchers revealed that the ratio of vowels to consonants in infant speech decline from birth to 8 months. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to pitch and intonation, preverbal infants have demonstrated communicative intent in their speech. Stark et al. (1993) measured the communicative intent of 51 infants aged birth to 18 months, that they divided into four age categories. They found that early sounds (birth&ndash;2 months), said to be vegetative sounds, included coughing, burping, crying, grunting and sighing. Infants aged 2&ndash;5 months added pleasure sounds like laughter and comfort sounds. During the ages of 6&ndash;9 months, the sounds also included objects, such that the acoustic pattern was often altered by an object or hand in the mouth. At 10&ndash;18 months, infants could also make sounds with intent of social communication. These sounds included words of desire, rejection, feeling, surprise, greetings, as well as animal noises, car noises, agreement (&ldquo;yes&rdquo;) and disagreement (&ldquo;no&rdquo;; Stark et al., 1993). Differences in communicative intent may be used as a clear indicator of vocal maturity among infants aged 0-18 months.</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4 c10">Adult Listener Discriminative Ability</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c1">Previous literature has examined adults&rsquo; abilities to recognize and interpret infant vocalizations and compared discrimination ability between males and females (Lindov&aacute; et al., 2015). Other studies, such as Parson et al. (2017), have investigated the accuracy in discriminating infant vocalizations between individuals with caregiver experience and those without. As exploratory analyses, the current study aims to add to the literature by investigating potential differences between males and females, and between caregivers and non-caregivers in their ability to discriminate between infant vocalizations.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c1">Lindov&aacute; et al. (2015) examined differences between men and women as well as caregivers and non-caregivers who completed babble discrimination tasks. To do this, they exposed men and women to emotionally loaded infant vocalizations and measured the adults&rsquo; ability to discriminate between a positively- or negatively-charged vocalization. Although the effects were weak, caregiver experience was positively associated with more accurate discriminations; however, the listener&rsquo;s gender had no significant effect on their accuracy. Lindov&aacute; et al. also found that age had a small effect on vocalization accuracy, such that younger adults were slightly more accurate compared to older adults. Adult listeners could accurately discriminate between positive and negative emotional vocalizations but had difficulty identifying the specific needs of the infants from the vocalizations. This suggests that adults may require other sensory channels to determine specific infant needs (Lindov&aacute; et al., 2015). </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c1">Another category of caregiver that has shown unique neural and behavioural responses to infant vocalizations is mothers. Parsons et al. (2017) performed a similar study examining mothers and non-mothers&rsquo; responses to infant vocalizations on a neural level. Using functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI), Parsons et al. found that rearing a child (i.e., more experience with an infant) had an impact on neural processing of infant cues compared to non-mothers, suggesting that greater infant experience leads to greater and differential neural reactivity, specifically in the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Findings were consistent with previous literature highlighting the positive effect of infant expeirence on vocaliziation discrimination ability (Lindov&aacute; et al., 2015). Furthermore, Parsons et al. suggested that the increase in neural reactivity represents an increased brain capacity and the shaping of neural responses experienced by parents in the caregiving process. These findings provide evidence to suggest that caregivers and non-caregivers have different brain structures and brain activity, and that experience with infants causes increased activity and shaping of specific neural pathways.</span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c1 c4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother-infant associations during infant vocalization have unique relationships at both the neural (Parsons et al., 2017) and behavioural (Hiraoka et al., 2019) levels, compared to non-mothers. Previous research from Hiaroka et al. (2019) outlined the association of pleasant stimuli to approach behaviour and aversive stimuli to avoidance behaviour. The latest research into the effect of infant vocalizations on maternal approach-avoidance behaviour found the opposite response in mothers (Hiraoka et al., 2019). Mothers reacted immediately with approach behaviours when infants elicited a crying or urgent response, suggesting that responding to infant emotional cues is a process unique to mothers. These results add a novel finding to infant vocalization literature that suggests maternal approach behaviours are a direct behavioural response to infant emotional cues (Hiraoka et al., 2019).</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4 c1">As mentioned before, previous studies have examined specific variables of adult listener discriminative ability such as gender and caregiving experience (Lindova et al., 2015) and mothers versus non-mothers&rsquo; discriminative ability (Parsons et al., 2017). Taking this into account, our hypotheses are also based on testing the participants ability to identify different infant vocalizations. Contrasting to previous research, this study aims to add to the current literature by examining the preverbal discriminative ability of adult listeners. In the present study, adults listened to audio clips of infant vocalizations and identified the sex, age range, and native langauge of the infants. Furthermore, this study will add to the existing literature by examining the effects of caregiving experience and gender on discriminative ability. Participants will be evaluated on their accuracy to identify specific characteristics of infant vocalizations. In sum, our primary objective will be to examine adults&#39; ability to discriminate the age, language and sex of infant vocalizations. As a second objective, we will examine the role of gender and caregiving experience. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c4 c10">Hypotheses</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1 c16">This study tested three </span><span class="c1 c16">preregistered</span><span class="c1 c16">, confirmatory </span><span class="c1 c16">hypotheses</span><span class="c4 c1">&nbsp;and two exploratory hypotheses.

That is, we were not able to subset the data in such a way that ensured that equal numbers of English and non-English babies were included, while controlling for equal numbers of male and female babies as well as equal number of babies in each age group. Therefore, we selected two separate samples; one for the sex hypothesis and one for the age and language hypotheses. We had six categories of babies for age and language hypotheses sample (</span><span class="c1 c3">English/non-English+age range groups; e.g, English+0-7)</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;and two categories of babies for the sex hypothesis sample (</span><span class="c1 c3 c31">non-English+8-18+Male/Female)</span><span class="c2 c1">.</span></p><p class="c8 c15"><span class="c1">For the age and language audio samples, we randomly selected two babies from each category and 20 clips from each baby.

For an added level of control the sex sample was only selected from non-english speaking babies who where 8-18 months old. In total, we had 200 clips for the sex sample.

After excluding the recommended clips we were left with fewer than 10 clips for some of the selected babies. Another researcher then randomly selected and screened unused clips for each of these babies until there were 10 usable clips for each selected baby (one clip added into the age and language sample, three clips added into the sex sample). Then, 10 clips were randomly selected from each baby in our sample.

Furthermore, variables such as adult listener&rsquo;s sex, and infant caregiving experience might affect the caregiver&rsquo;s ability to communicate with infants. In this study, we measured whether English-speaking monolingual adults can identify the sex, language, and age</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c1">of an infant after listening to short audio recordings of infant vocalizations and examined the factors that might have an effect on their ability to determine the infant variables. </span></p><p class="c8 c15"><span class="c1">Contrary to our initial hypothesis, w</span><span class="c1">e found that participants were slightly worse than chance at identifying an infant&rsquo;s sex</span><span class="c2 c1">. However, we did find that participants could identify whether the language that the infant was learning was English or non-English better than random chance. Participant&rsquo;s were also able to identify the infant&rsquo;s age range much better than chance. Our exploratory analyses indicated that neither childcare nor caregiving experience significantly affected the ability of the participants to identify the infants&rsquo; age or language. Nor did participant&rsquo;s gender have an effect on identifying the infants&rsquo; age or language.</span></p><p class="c8 c15"><span class="c1">The current study examined adult participants&rsquo; ability to identify characteristics like age, sex and the language used in the infant&rsquo;s environment using infant vocalizations. Results from our study are consistent with previous findings that adults are able to identify the relative age and primary language of an infant (Olney &amp; Scholnick, 1976; de Boysson-Bardies et al., 1984). Adults&rsquo; ability to identify infant characteristics from their vocalizations could have an important impact on adult-infant interactions. Previous research shows that infants&rsquo; vocalizations mature in response to sophisticated adult vocalizations (Goldstein &amp; Schwade, 2008). Our findings, therefore, suggest that adults use identifying vocal cues to facilitate appropriate and contingent responding to enhance language development in infants. As prior research has not analyzed listener&rsquo;s ability to identify infants sex from vocalizations, our study makes a novel contribution to the existing literature on language development. Contrary to our expectations, our findings suggest that </span><span class="c1">participants were not able to identify infants&rsquo; sex better than chance</span><span class="c1">. </span><span class="c1">We hypothesize that this is the case because there is little to no discernible difference between the sounds from a male or female infant within these age ranges. </span><span class="c2 c1">Also contrary to prior research findings, we found that adult participants with childcare/caregiving experience did not perform better than participants who had no childcare/caregiving experience, at identifying infants&rsquo; age or language. Our results support Lindov&aacute; et al. (2015) who found that participants&rsquo; gender does not affect their ability to accurately identify infant characteristics.</span></p><p class="c8 c15"><span class="c1">One minor limitation was that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were not able to conduct our research as originally planned, by means of in-person data collection. Therefore, we had to adapt our experiment to be run online.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;However, we have no reason to believe that this adversely affected our results, as online data collection has been widely validated in a large number of different psychological tasks </span><span class="c1">(Crump et al., 2013)</span><span class="c1">. In terms of our exclusion criteria, 166 </span><span class="c1">participants</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;had to be excluded from our sample. However, exclusion of these participants was integral, in particular in relation to our language question, as the knowledge of Spanish, Tsimane&#39;, Y&ecirc;l&iacute;-Dnye, Tseltal Mayan, or Quechua could have impacted participants&#39; ability to identify these other languages, causing this subgroup of participants to systematically vary in their responses.</span></p><p class="c8 c15"><span class="c1">Although we ended up adapting our experiment to be run online, we did not end up posting it outside of the University of Manitoba. Thus, as with a large amount of other research, this poses limits to the generalizability of our research findings. </span><span class="c1">In particular, our sample likely consists of </span><span class="c1">WEIRD</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;subjects </span><span class="c1">(</span><span class="c1">Henrich et al., 2010</span><span class="c1">)</span><span class="c1">. </span><span class="c2 c1">WEIRD (Western, educated, and from industrialized, rich, and democratic countries) subjects are typically composed of university-aged samples that have demographic attributes that are fairly narrow in range, in terms of age, socioeconomic status, and cultural norms, where subjects from the University of Manitoba certainly fit this description. Therefore, future directions could include expanding our data collection to platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, or to mirror other large collaborative efforts, such as the ManyLabs and ManyBabies projects (Klein et al, 2014; Bergmann et al., 2017), as a way to include other research labs and diversify our sample.</span></p><p class="c8 c15"><span class="c1">Another limitation is in regards to the materials we used, particularly in relation to our research design. We are grateful to the BabbleCor team (Meg Cychosz, Amanda Seidl, Elika Bergelson, Marisa Casillas, Gladys Baudet, Anne S. Warlaumont, Camila Scaff, Lisa Yankowitz, and Alejandrina Cristia) for the development of and providing us with the BabbleCor dataset (Cychosz et al., 2020). However, the number of research questions we set out to investigate (e.g. can participants identify the age, sex, and language of infants) and the available data in the BabbleCor database did not allow us to subset our materials in a way that allowed us to run a full factorial design. We accounted for this by setting a more stringent alpha rate to 0.01 to adjust for the number of questions we were asking, however, </span><span class="c1">future efforts could include contributing to and deriving a larger database of infant vocalizations, consistent with efforts such as the citizen science project hosed on Zooniverse: &ldquo;Maturity of Baby Sounds&rdquo; </span><span class="c1">(</span><span class="c9 c1"><a class="c17" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/chiarasemenzin/maturity-of-baby-sounds&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1586815314874000">https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/chiarasemenzin/maturity-of-baby-sounds</a></span><span class="c1">). </span><span class="c2 c1">This would not only satisfy needs such as our own, but would make materials available to other interested researchers as well.</span></p><p class="c8 c15"><span class="c1">This research represents a novel contribution to the field of developmental science as little research has been done examining adult judgements of infant vocalizations. This literature is important because it allows us to examine the dynamic of caregiver-infant vocal interactions in a way that has been largely neglected; from the perspective of an adult. </span><span class="c2 c1">The judgements adults make about infant language and age range are important, as language development in infants is a dynamic social process, and, as adults modify their speech in response to infant vocalizations (Elmlinger et al., 2019), development is facilitated. This study contributes to this body of literature by demonstrating that as a whole, adults are accurately able to make these judgements about infant vocalizations, which has never before been demonstrated.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c5 c15"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c13 c15"><span class="c10">References</span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Adani, S., &amp; Cepanec, M.
